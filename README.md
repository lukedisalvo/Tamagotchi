## Tamagotchi Game
This repository contains the code for a Tamagotchi project using Texas Instrument's MSP432 microcontroller.

## Description
Creates a game where we take care of a Tamagotchi by playing with it and feeding it. 
You can feed the Tamagotchi with a button and moving 3 times will raise it's happiness bar.
A Tamagotchi appears on the LCD display within the borders. 
The Tamagotchi has 4 states, egg, child and adult and death states. 
The Tamagotchi moves within the borders in 6 different position making a 2x3 grid of positions. 
Movement can be attained by pressing the ‘w’, ‘a’, ‘s’, and ‘d’ keys on your keyboard. 
‘w’ will make the Tamagotchi move up, ‘a’ move left, ‘s’ move down, and ‘d’ move right.
If happiness runs out, then your Tamagotchi dies.

## How to Run
If you have access to Texas Instrument's MSP432 microcontroller and have downloaded CCS (Code Composer Studio), 
then simply importing and running the project with ccs' play button will run the game.
